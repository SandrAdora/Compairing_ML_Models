#Introduction 

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool for predicting various deseases, such as diabetis and its risks, leveraging complex paterns in clinical and lifestyle data to identify individuals as high risk of developing diabetes. However, with numerous ML models available, the question remains: which one performs best in predicting diabetes?

Diabetes is defined as a state of hyperglycemia in either fasting or postprandial states. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with end organ damage, dysfunction, and failure in organs and tissues including the retina, kidney, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. The International Diabetes Federation (I D F) estimates an overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus to be 366 million in 2011, and this is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030 (Whiting et al., 2011). A consensus statement published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 published the current diagnostic criteria for diabetes a fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dL ( 7.0 mmol/L) on two occasions or more a 2 hour plasma glucose  200 mg/dL ( 11.1 mmol/L) after 75 g glucose load (oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT)a random plasma glucose  200 mg/d ( 11.1 mmol/L).
The alarming prevalence of diabetis has sparked a pressing need for effective early detection and prevention strategies. This project uses a supervised learning* method and it aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of popular machine learning models for diabetes prediction, including K-nearest Neighbor, support vector machines, and neural networks. By evaluating the performance of these models on a diverse range of datasets, I seek to identify the most accurate and reliable approach for predicting diabetes. This analysis will delve into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, exploring their ability to handle imbalanced datasets.
